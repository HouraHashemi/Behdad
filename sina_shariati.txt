Dear Behdad, 
the man with the kindest of feelings :)

It was at 02 of Khordad when we met at the campus library and you were trying to write a script to sanitize some data using bash script and you needed help
Although I wasn't sure what was the problem, I said I can help and we became friends :)
From that moment till now you have been a good friend to me, and have shown me a lot of important listens in different circumstances, tnx for all of your efforts :)
It was a blessing that the COVID-19 pandemic cooled off a bit and AUT decided to continue its courses on site and I was able to meet you and many other wonderful people.
Take care, good friend.
And remember, ALWAYS REACH FOR THE FURTHEST OF THE DREAMS :)
With kindest regards,
Sina Shariat.
